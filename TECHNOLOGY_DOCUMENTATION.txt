## Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Backend Questions

**Q1: How is JWT authentication implemented?**
A: JWT tokens are generated on login, stored in localStorage, and sent in Authorization headers. Spring Security validates tokens on each request using a custom filter.

**Q2: How do you handle file uploads?**
A: Using MultipartFile with Spring Boot, files are stored locally in uploads/ directory with proper validation for file types and sizes.

**Q3: How is email functionality implemented?**
A: Spring Boot Mail with Gmail SMTP configuration. Email templates are created dynamically and sent asynchronously for better performance.

**Q4: How do you handle database relationships?**
A: Using JPA annotations like @OneToMany, @ManyToOne with proper cascade operations and foreign key constraints.

**Q5: How is API documentation generated?**
A: Using Swagger/OpenAPI 3 with annotations to automatically generate interactive API documentation.

### Frontend Questions

**Q1: How is state managed across components?**
A: Using React Context API for global state (authentication) and local state with useState for component-specific data.

**Q2: How are API calls handled?**
A: Using Axios with interceptors for token attachment and error handling. API calls are organized in service files.

**Q3: How is routing implemented?**
A: React Router DOM v6 with protected routes that check authentication status before allowing access.

**Q4: How is responsive design achieved?**
A: Tailwind CSS utility classes with responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) and Material-UI's Grid system.

**Q5: How are forms validated?**
A: Client-side validation using controlled components with useState, plus server-side validation for security.

### Full-Stack Questions

**Q1: How does frontend communicate with backend?**
A: RESTful APIs with JSON data exchange. Frontend sends HTTP requests with JWT tokens, backend responds with JSON data.

**Q2: How is security implemented end-to-end?**
A: JWT tokens for authentication, role-based access control, input validation on both ends, and CORS configuration.

**Q3: How is error handling implemented?**
A: Global error handling with try-catch blocks, custom error responses from backend, and user-friendly error messages on frontend.

**Q4: How is the application deployed?**
A: Backend as Spring Boot JAR, frontend as static files served by web server, with MySQL database and file storage.

**Q5: How is performance optimized?**
A: Database indexing, lazy loading, pagination, image optimization, code splitting, and caching strategies.
